*CS 166: Data Structures, created and taught by Keith Schwarz, delves deep into data structures and teaches powerful associated concepts and techniques. It gives a taste of this exciting area of theoretical computer science, and goes into some advanced material. The description of the course is [here][description] and the course website is [here][website]. This post covers the first lecture, Range Minimum Queries (Part 1), for which the slides can be found [here][slides].*

This lecture introduces the Range Minimum Query problem, abbreviated RMQ. This turns out to be a great way to start off the course since the RMQ problem involves a number of interesting (and beautiful!) concepts and techniques. The statement of the problem, taken from the lecture slides, is the following: given an array $A$ and two indices $i \leq j$, what is the smallest element out of $A[i], A[i+1], \dots, A[j-1], A[j]$? The image below, from the slides, shows an example query for which $26$ is the answer.
