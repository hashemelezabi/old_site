*This blog post is a course notes post: lecture notes written in the style of a blog post. It follows the lecture closely, occasionally taking words verbatim from the slides. Sometimes, I will add extra material beyond the lecture (under "Interlude" or "Extra" subheadings) or implement an algorithm discussed in lecture (making sure not to implement anything assigned as homework). The purposes of these notes are 1) to help me understand the material more deeply by forcing me to explain every detail, 2) to explore the course material beyond lectures, 3) to practice my technical writing, and 4) to provide another source on the material that potentially helps other students.*
