For my Graph Theory class, I studied and wrote a survey paper on Barnette's conjecture, which has stood for almost 50 years and states that every planar, 3-regular, 3-connected, bipartite graph is Hamiltonian. I introduce the history of the conjecture (including the preceding conjectures of Tait and Tutte), and prove a few results around it, taken from various sources published over the years.

**Abstract:** In 1969, David Barnette conjectured that every 3-regular, 3-connected, bipartite, planar graph is Hamiltonian. The conjecture remains an open problem in graph theory to this day. In this project, we survey Barnette's conjecture, starting from its historical development and motivation, and covering a few results throughout its almost 50-year history.
