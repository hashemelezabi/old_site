For my Modern Algebra class, I studied and wrote a class paper on algebraic automata theory, mainly introducing semigroup theory and building up and proving the Krohn-Rhodes decomposition theorem. The following is the abstract of the paper.

**Abstract:** In 1965, Kenneth Krohn and John Rhodes proved that every finite automaton can be decomposed into a cascade of very simple automata consisting of two types, reset automata and permutation automata. They proved this using algebraic techniques, marking the first major study of finite automata via modern algebra and earning two simultaneous PhDs for their work. The main connection between automata and algebra stems from the fact that every finite automaton has a corresponding *transformation semigroup*. In fact, the Krohn-Rhodes theorem above can be restated in purely semigroup-theoretic terms: every finite semigroup divides a wreath product of finite simple groups and finite aperiodic semigroups. In this way, the theorem proves a significant statement about semigroups themselves, and reveals a deep connection between finite automata and finite semigroups. In this paper, we introduce finite automata theory and finite semigroup theory, explain the correspondence between automata and semigroups, and prove the Krohn-Rhodes theorem in the language of semigroup theory.
