<p>I’m Hashem – thanks for visiting my website. I’m a student at Stanford University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I’m focused on algorithms, machine learning, and computer systems. Here’s <a href="assets/docs/resume.pdf">my resume</a>.</p>

<p>I love working on hard problems, especially ones that have a real-world impact. I’ve worked on projects in areas ranging from machine learning and automata theory to parallel computing and app development, in both research and industry settings.</p>

<p>I’m always looking for opportunities to explore new terrain in the wonderful world of computer science and software engineering!</p>
