# Hello!

{% smallmarginfigure "my-photo" "assets/img/me.jpg" "" %}

I'm Hashem -- thanks for visiting my website. I'm a student at Stanford University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I'm interested in algorithms, machine learning, and computer systems. Here's [my resume](assets/docs/resume.pdf).

I've worked on projects in areas ranging from machine learning and automata theory to parallel computing and app development, in both research and industry settings. Check out some of my [projects](/projects), or take a look at my [blog](/blog)!
