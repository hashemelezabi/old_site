# Hello!

I'm Hashem -- thanks for visiting my website. I'm an undergraduate student at Stanford University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I'm interested in algorithms, machine learning, and computer systems. 

I love working on hard problems, especially ones that have a real-world impact. I have worked on significant projects in both industry and academia, as well as a number of personal projects. Check out a comprehensive list here!
