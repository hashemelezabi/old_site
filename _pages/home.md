    title: "Algebraic theory of automata and semigroups"
    excerpt: "For my Modern Algebra class, I studied and wrote a class paper on algebraic automata theory, mainly introducing semigroup theory and building up and proving the Krohn-Rhodes decomposition theorem. (Figure from *Nine Chapters on the Semigroup Art* by Alan J. Cain)"

    title: "Barnette's conjecture"
    excerpt: "For my Graph Theory class, I studied and wrote a survey paper on Barnette's conjecture, which states that every planar, 3-regular, 3-connected, bipartite graph is Hamiltonian. I introduce the history of the conjecture, and prove a few results around it, taken from various sources published over the years."
